// linear data structure that includes a series of connected nodes
// each node consists of a data value and a pointer that points to the next node
// the list elements can be easily inserted or removed without reallocation or reorganization of the entire structure
// random access of elements is not feasible
// main ops in a linked list - 1. Insertion - add an element at the beginning, end or at a given index in the list. 2. Deletion - remove an item given its index or value. 3 search - find an element given its value
// linked lists are used to implement stacks and queues
//  (head)10 -> 20 -> 30 -> null
