// follows the principle of First in first out (FIFO).............. Queue of people in a line
// Queue data structure supports two main ops: 1. Enqueue - adds an element at the tail of the collection. 2. Dequeue - removes an element from the head of the collection.
// apart from enqueue and dequeue, there is also 1. Peek - gets the value of element at the front of the queue without removing it. 2. isEmpty - checks if the queue is empty. 3. size - gets the number of elements in the queue. 4. print - visualize the elements in the queue.
// shift - removes the first element from an array and returns the element
// unshift - adds a new element at the beginning of the array and return the new length of the array.
// pop - removes the last element of the array and returns the element
// push - adds an element at the end of the array and returns the length of the array

class Queue{

    // create a constructor to intialize a new list

    constructor(){
        this.Queue = []
    }
